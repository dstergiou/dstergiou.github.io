      <description>Information security is a set of strategies for managing the processes, tools, people and policies necessary to prevent, detect, document and counter threats to digital and non-digital information. Although information security used to be considered the job of IT, it has reached a state where it covers the whole organization and it&amp;rsquo;s an integral part of any Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.

      <description>The Personal Data Act and EU’s forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) define that organizations have an obligation to protect personal information against unauthorized use.
We help you to protect your data; in use, in transit or at rest. Whether you gather data directly from the data subjects or indirectly you must do it in a transparent and privacy ensuring way. When analyzing the collected data, whether on-premise or in cloud, you need to ensure only correct parties have access to it and the results.</description>

      <description>The earlier a security bug is discovered in the development lifecycle, the lesser the cost will be to remedy the bug. This may sound like a cliché, but we have seen it happening multiple times. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe us, believe all the research that been done on the idea of defect cost curve.
By introducing an SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) into your development processes you ensure that a number of key activities are performed at the appropriate time - activities that can lead to more secure systems and less cost for keeping them secure.</description>

      <description>We realize that the iGaming world has rigorous certifications that can only be undertaken by authorized and (sometimes) pre-approved testing agencies (labs). If this is what you are looking for, we can&amp;rsquo;t help you - not today at least.
But if you are looking for someone to help you prepare your organization before applying for a gaming license, or you are looking for someone to help you set up your management system in a way that the testing agencies will find suitable, then look no further.</description>

      <description>Social engineering attacks such as phishing, spear phishing and voice phishing (vishing) are becoming the most popular methods for an attacker to get a foothold in an organization. Considering that these attacks are easy to execute and pose minimum danger for the attacker, it&amp;rsquo;s no question that your organization will have to defend against them successfully if you want to maintain a secure environment.
